Welcome to the automatic Sudoku solver!
=======================================

This project aims to solve sudoku puzzles using python the same way humans do! It seems easy to use a program to solve by trial and error, but we aim to solve using the same methods used by humans to solve the various puzzles.

Status:

Currently, the solver will complete easy problems which rely on the first two principles of Sudoku solving:

One possibility: A box can only be one value since all other values are used in its row, column and region

Last Possibility: Of several boxes in a region, column or row, only one can take on a value (though it may have more possibilities) and thus must be that value.

The solver can use these to solve most medium and easy Sudoku puzzles. I am currently working on the harder ones.
