{"name":"Sudoku","tagline":"Solve Sudoku puzzles!","body":"### Welcome to the automatic Sudoku solver!\r\n  This project aims to solve sudoku puzzles using python the same way humans do!\r\nIt seems easy to use a program to solve by trial and error, but we aim to solve using the same methods used by humans to solve the various puzzles.\r\n\r\n### Status:\r\n  Currently, the solver will complete easy problems which rely on the first two principles of Sudoku solving:\r\n\r\n1. **One possibility:**\r\nA box can only be one value since all other values are used in its row, column and region\r\n\r\n2. **Last Possibility:**\r\nOf several boxes in a region, column or row, only one can take on a value (though it may have more possibilities) and thus must be that value.\r\n\r\nThis project is very early in its development. Thank you for your understanding.\r\n\r\n- Renmusxd","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
